# How to Use Image Description-based Renamer

This guide explains how to use the **Image Description-based Renamer** script to rename folders or image files based on the description generated from the image content.

## Requirements

Before using the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

You can install the `requests` library using pip:

```sh
pip install requests
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-description-renamer.git
   cd image-description-renamer
   ```
   
2. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Usage

To rename folders or image files based on the image descriptions, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script:

   ```sh
   cd path/to/image-description-renamer
   ```
   
3a. Run the script without any arguments to rename folders based on the image descriptions:

   ```sh
   python script_name.py
   ```
4a. This will rename the folders containing the images based on the descriptions generated by the Ollama API.

3b. If you want to rename image files based on the descriptions, pass `image` as an argument:

   ```sh
   python script_name.py image
   ```
   
4b. This will rename the image files themselves based on the descriptions generated by the Ollama API.

## Configuration

- Ensure the Ollama API is running locally on `http://localhost:11434`.
- Modify the API endpoint in the script if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues while running the script, ensure you have a stable internet connection and that the Ollama API is accessible.

- Check the Python version and make sure it meets the requirements specified in the `README.md`.

- If you encounter errors related to missing modules, install them using pip.
